This is a work in progress.

Just a little something I'm using to jump start a site refresh. I like to think of it as a starter for building a Jekyll site.
Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. I purposely keep the styling minimal and bare to make it easier to add ones own flare and markup.
